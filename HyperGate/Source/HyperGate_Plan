The HyperGate Mod for KSP

Basic principles: (initial version)
        - Each Gate comprises 8 segments, these must be contructed in obrit in order to function.
        
        - Once the Gate is constructed they can be 'aligned'.
        
        - Gates fomr matched pairs and you must have two unlinked gates in order to 'align' a pair.
        
        - When a gate is 'aligned' it forms a 'bridge/link' which allows vessels to pass through.
        
        - Gates must be 'aligned' in order for the 'birdge/link' to form and once aligned it can only be undone by destruction of one of the two gates.
        
        - Gate travel is only supported up to a certain mass (actual mass limit TBD)
        
        - A HyperGate Transponder is required to use the HyperGate system.

Predicted functions of each PartModule:

ModulehGateDock

        Using ModuleDockingNode; this part module will perform the function of a stock stocking port with these properties:
        - docking can only be acehived in 1 orientation (it can connect to another segemnt only the corrct way).
        - uses a gendered "nodeType = hGateDP" node to only mate with other segments in the correct position.
        This part module will also have the folloing additions:
        - Once docked it cannot be undocked.
        - Increments to the vessels 'hGateSegTotal' count when docked (need to do this cleanly somehow).
        
ModulehGateBeacon

        This is what the HyperGate looks for when 'aligning', invisible when gate is unfinished.
        - using the hGateSegTotal' count; when all the required nodes are docked (16 in total) the gate is then visible to other, unaligned gates.
        - when a gate is 'alinged' then th ebeacon is no longer visible to other gates.
